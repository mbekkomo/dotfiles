Make sure your machine is a x86_64 Linux and has installed Nix 2.4+
```sh
./bake switch
```
This might also works with nix-darwin and nix-on-droid, but requires some tweaks to get it working.

```sh
# Structures
.            # Root
├── configs  # Configurations
├── etc      # Misc. files added to home
└── fonts    # Fonts
```
